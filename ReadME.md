# DearDiary

A simple diary writing application. Built using Express, SCSS, and vanilla JavaScript(something I definitely wouldn't recommend).

## Development setup

Install the LTS version of Node and run the following commands in your terminal.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheTrio/DearDiary.git
npm install
npm start
```

You should have a development server running on `localhost:3000`.

## Features

-   AES-256 encryption for diary entries
-   A way to view random entries
-   A WYSIWYG editor for writing entries
-   A (rather complicated) way to export entries
-   A functional dark mode
